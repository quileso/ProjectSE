This reposintoy is in requiuemtn for the final software project.


This code is designed to create a game called Wandering in the Woods.

In this game People are “lost in the woods” where the woods are represented by a rectangular grid. The woods are dense, and the people can’t see or hear each other until they are in the same cell of the grid.

The code is designed for two grade levels: K-2 or 3-5

In grades K-2, the grids are always square, there are always two people, and they start out in diagonally opposite corners of the grid. They wander about randomly, and each move is counted, with a counter for each person. Music plays as cartoon characters wander in the woods. When the people bump into each other, there is a happy graphics display, and statistics from the wandering are displayed and announced audibly. Then the game is reset, and students can start it up again.

For grades 3-5, students can set up the size of a grid, which can be rectangular (instead of just square). There can be 2, 3, or 4 people, and students can place them wherever on their grid. Once the game is started, it can be played and replayed multiple times. Statistics (such as longest run without meeting, shortest run, and average run) are displayed.

If the game is played with 3 or 4 players, if two find each other, they will be moving together until they find the third player. In the same way, if the third player is found (assuming we have 4 players), the three players will move together until the fourth player is found
